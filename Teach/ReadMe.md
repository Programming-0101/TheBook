# An Intro to "The Book"

This site is broken into two major parts: [**The Book**](intro.md) and [**The Code**](../Topic/). Here you will find my approach to teaching programming for people who have never programmed before. If you already have some experience with programming, I hope that you find the resources helpful in giving you an Object-Oriented perspective on programming &mdash; feel free to jump around to whatever piques your interest.

If you're just starting out, you will find that I try to make some distinctions between "[theory](intro.md)" and "[practice](../Topic/)". Teaching with examples is great, as is having a lot of hands-on practice. But behind the pragmatics of learning a programming language is the mindset you take to programming and the art of software design. Here, I share my thoughts in both of these areas as they affect beginners.

What follows in this section is a set of articles describing the foundations of OOP programming. But all of this is just "theory" without [good samples](../Topic/ReadMe.md). Keep reading to get the fundamentals, and feel free to jump right into [**The Code**](../Topic/intro.md) whenever you want for some hands-on samples.
