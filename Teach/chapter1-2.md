# Problem Solving

::: warning First Draft
This write-up is a first-draft. Expect it to be incomplete, riddled with bullet-points and to-do items, vague, and even incorrect. YMMV.

Software development is all about facing problems and coming up with solutions to those problems. Of course, our preferred medium of solutions is to create *computer programs* or *software*. But ***how*** do we create those solutions? How do we solve problems?

## Primary Concerns

Becoming "good" at solving problems is an ongoing exercise of knowing three things.

Know The Problem
: What is it that you are trying to solve? Do you understand the context of the problem? Being able to articulate what you are trying to achieve and the obstacles you are facing is the starting point.

Know The Language
: If you're creating a software solution, you are probably using some kind of programming language. The more articulate you are in that language, the better you will be in expressing your intent and getting the computer to "do what you want."

Know The Tools
: Nobody really uses just a plain text editor anymore. Typically, developers work with some kind of IDE (*Integrated Development Environment*). These tools are typically quite powerful, and the better you understand how they work and what you can do with them, the better off you will be when it comes time to cut some code[^a].

[^a]: "Cutting code" is slang for "writing code".

### Understand the Problem

> Becoming Self-Aware of The Goal



### Understand your Programming Language

### Get Familiar with your Tools

Even if you enjoy writing the code in a "simple" editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), those editors are filled with features that exist to improve your productivity.
