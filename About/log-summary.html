A Learning Outcome Guide is simply a list of specific things that the student (or reader, in this case) should be able to do or understand as a result of learning the material. LOGs give the learner the ability to self-check their progress (&quot;Can I do <em>X</em>?&quot;).</p> <p>This appendix provides a shortened review of what each learning outcome is all about. For instructors, it provides a quick summary of the intent of the LOG. For students, it provides the answers. 😃</p> <h2 id="topic-a-starting-classes"><a href="#topic-a-starting-classes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Topic A - Starting Classes</h2> <h3 id="oop-basics"><a href="#oop-basics" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> OOP Basics</h3> <dl><dt>Define the term &quot;class&quot; as used in OOP</dt> <dd>A class is a template that acts as the basis for creating objects and describes a) What it &quot;looks like&quot;, and b) How it &quot;works&quot;.</dd> <dt>Explain the purpose of classes in computer programs</dt> <dd>Classes allow programmers to define their own complex data types, complete with their own internal data (fields) and behaviours (methods).</dd> <dt>Describe the primary keywords used in declaring a class</dt> <dd>public/private - identifies whether the class is visible to other code; public means all other code can see this class, while private means</dd> <dd>class - declares that this is a class definition (tells the compiler to interpret this as a new &quot;classification&quot; or &quot;kind&quot; of data type; that is, a complex )</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;method&quot; and give an example</dt> <dd>A method is a set of instructions that manipulate information.</dd> <dt>Create simple classes with methods only</dt> <dd>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</dd> <dt>Explain what is meant by &quot;overloading&quot;</dt> <dd>Overloading describes creating more than one method with the same method name (but different parameters) in the same class.

(Namespaces help to prevent a &quot;collision&quot; or confusion on the part of a compiler when confronted with two or more classes with the same name.)</dd></dl> <h3 id="general-programming-concepts-and-terms"><a href="#general-programming-concepts-and-terms" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> General Programming Concepts and Terms</h3> <dl><dt>Define the term &quot;keyword&quot; as it applies to programming languages</dt> <dd>A keyword is a special command or instruction that is part of (that is, built in to, or &quot;intrinsic&quot; to) a programming language. Keywords are &quot;reserved&quot; words, meaning that they cannot be used for other purposes, such as being a name of a class, a variable, or a method.</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;identifier&quot; as it applies to programming languages</dt> <dd>An identifier is a programmer-supplied name for some item, either a class name, a field or local variable, or a method.</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;program statement&quot; and identify how the computer recognizes a program statement</dt> <dd>A program statement is combination of keywords, identifiers, punctuation, and/or literal values that, together, represent a single &quot;instruction&quot; or &quot;command&quot; that a compiler can translate into executable code.</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;syntax&quot; as it applies to programming languages.</dt> <dd>Syntax refers to the rules of a programming language that define how to combine keywords, identifiers, literal values, and other symbols to create specific instructions for a computer program.</dd> <dt>Identify the entry point for every computer program</dt> <dd>Every computer program must supply a method called &quot;main&quot; as the method that the operating system will call (execute) to begin running the program.</dd> <dt>Perform simple output to the console using System.Console</dt> <dd>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</dd> <dt>Identify the basic structure of a simple C# program</dt> <dd>A C# program must consist of at least one class and have a single &quot;main&quot; method as the program's entry point. Typically, a C# program will consist of a &quot;driver&quot; (the class that has the main method) and other classes used to represent objects (data) in the program.</dd> <dt>Explain what is meant by a &quot;driver&quot;</dt> <dd>A &quot;driver&quot; is a method or set of methods that &quot;run&quot; or control the execution of a program; it's responsibility is to direct and maintain the &quot;lifetime&quot; of a program, and makes use of classes and objects to achieve the purpose of the program. Every driver begins its execution in a method called &quot;main&quot; (which is the name given for the entry point for every computer program).</dd> <dt>Explain what is meant by a &quot;case-sensitive&quot; programming language</dt> <dd>A case-sensitive language is one  where the compiler regards &quot;identical&quot; words as different if they differ only in their case. In other words, a case-sensitive language will regard two identifiers are distinct if the only difference is whether they are spelled with upper- or lower-case characters. For example, HelloWorld and Helloworld will be regarded as different because one has a capital &quot;W&quot; and the other has a lower-case &quot;w&quot;.</dd> <dt>Explain what is meant by a &quot;strongly-typed&quot; programming language</dt> <dd>A &quot;strongly-typed&quot; programming language is one that requires all variables or objects to always match or conform to whatever data type they were originally declared as. Some programming languages (such as C#Script) allow variables or objects to &quot;change&quot; their data type whenever a programmer wishes to use it for other purposes; strongly-typed languages do not allow variables to &quot;change&quot; the type of data they can store. Strongly-typed programming languages provide better security and make it more difficult for programmers to inadvertently corrupt, mangle or expose important data.</dd> <dt>Explain what &quot;string concatenation&quot; is and how it works</dt> <dd>String concatenation is where two or more strings are &quot;combined&quot; to create a longer string; this is represented in C# by &quot;adding&quot; strings together. For example, given two literal strings whose values are &quot;One&quot; and &quot;word&quot;, the result of &quot;One&quot; + &quot;word&quot; would be the string &quot;Oneword&quot;.</dd> <dt>Define and distinguish the terms &quot;argument&quot; and &quot;parameter&quot;</dt> <dd>A parameter is a variable declared in the parameter list of a method declaration; parameters are used to hold or capture information (values) that are sent or passed into the method. An argument is some value (either a literal value, a value stored in a variable, or some other value that comes from an &quot;expression&quot;) that is sent (passed) into a method; arguments appear in the syntax of method calls.</dd> <dt>Use single-line, multi-line and XML comments as a means of documenting code</dt> <dd>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</dd> <dt>List the four pieces of information to include in comments at the top of every source file</dt> <dd>The file name, author, creation date, and purpose of the file.</dd></dl> <h3 id="intro-to-ides"><a href="#intro-to-ides" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Intro to IDEs</h3> <dl><dt>Define the term &quot;IDE&quot; as it relates to software development tools</dt> <dd>The acronym &quot;IDE&quot; stands for &quot;Integrated Development Environment&quot;.

The internal values (state)for an object's fields can be changed independently of other objects of the same class.</dd> <dt>Describe the syntax of static and non-static method declarations</dt> <dd>Static methods are &quot;shared&quot; by all instances (objects) of a class, and can be called without even having to have an instance of the method's class.</dd> <dd>Non-static methods, on the other hand, can only be called for a given object (instance of a class) and will &quot;act on&quot; (or &quot;act on behalf of&quot;) that object (and any other objects are not affected by the given object's method call).</dd> <dt>Compare and contrast the syntax for method declarations (implementations) vs. method calls (for both static and non-static methods)</dt> <dd>…</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;field&quot; as used in OOP and give an example</dt> <dd>A field is a variable that belongs to a class and is shared by all the methods of a class.<br> <code>private static int sharedCount; // a static field</code><br> <code>private String name; // an instance field</code></dd> <dt>Compare and contrast instance and class members, for both methods and fields</dt> <dd>Static methods are shared by all instances of a class, and can be called independently from instances of a class, whereas instance methods can only be called if you have an object (an instance of a class).</dd> <dd>Static fields are shared by and fully accessible to all methods, but non-static fields, also called &quot;instance&quot; fields, are only shared by other non-static methods.

These simple data types are intrinsic (&quot;build into&quot;) the programming language. A language that supports &quot;type extensions&quot; simply allows the programmer to create or design new data types; these new types are typically &quot;complex&quot; types made up of zero or more other (either simple or complex) data types.</dd></dl> <h3 id="general-programming-concepts-and-terms-2"><a href="#general-programming-concepts-and-terms-2" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> General Programming Concepts and Terms</h3> <dl><dt>List the three categories of simple information</dt> <dd>Textual, numeric, and conceptual</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;intrinsic data type&quot;</dt> <dd>An &quot;intrinsic data type&quot; is one that is built into the programming language.</dd> <dt>Explain what an assignment statement is and how it works</dt> <dd>An assignment statement is an instruction to the computer to store a value into a specific variable (or object). The variable (or object) is placed on the left-hand side of the equals sign, and the value to be stored in the object is placed on the right-hand side of the equals sign.</dd> <dd>The left-hand side of an assignment statement must be a single variable, whereas the right-hand side can be any expression as long as the resulting value of the expression is the same (or compatible) data type as the variable on the left-hand side.</dd> <dt>Compare and contrast the three categories of simple information with the complex types of information which classes represent</dt> <dd>Simple information is either textual (such as a name), numeric (such as a total or count), or &quot;conceptual&quot; (that is, representing a more &quot;abstract&quot; value that is neither textual or numeric). An example of a textual type in C# is the char type. An example of a numeric type in C# is the double type. An example of a &quot;conceptual&quot; type is the boolean type. A variable whose type is one of the simple types can only hold a single, simple value at any given time.</dd> <dd>Complex types of information can be constructed from many simple types or from simple and complex types. A &quot;class&quot; is used to describe or define what the complex type looks like and how it works.  Complex types are the basis for creating objects, and while any given &quot;object variable&quot; can only reference a single object, that object may consist of many distinct &quot;values&quot;, each one being stored in a field that is &quot;hidden&quot; (or &quot;encapsulated&quot;) inside the object.</dd> <dt>Explain the advantages of using classes and objects instead of only using intrinsic data types</dt> <dd>By using objects, the programmer is no longer limited to having to only deal with simple values. By designing and using complex types (classes), the programmer is able to create complex programs using less code in a way that is simpler and more reliable than if the programmer were only allowed to use the simple types built into the programming language.</dd></dl> <h2 id="topic-c-starting-classes"><a href="#topic-c-starting-classes" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Topic C - Starting Classes</h2> <h3 id="oop-basics-3"><a href="#oop-basics-3" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> OOP Basics</h3> <dl><dt>Define the term &quot;encapsulation&quot; as used in OOP</dt> <dd>Encapsulation is a design principle of &quot;hiding&quot; fields in a class by always making them private and only allowing a &quot;controlled access&quot; to the values in fields by providing getters and setters.</dd> <dd>Encapsulation also includes the idea that all of the items (methods and fields) in a class always have access to each other (inside the class) while also providing the ability to control the external access to those items (methods and fields) by other classes.</dd> <dt>Explain why encapsulation is a good design principle</dt> <dd>Encapsulation is a good design principle because every object must be responsible for its own data; if an object &quot;exposes&quot; its fields for direct access (that is, makes those fields public), then that object cannot exert any control over the values that may be stored in those fields.</dd> <dd>Encapsulation, as a part of Object Oriented design, also facilitates the aspect of &quot;grouping together&quot; related fields and methods.</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;access specifier&quot; and identify where it occurs in the code for a class</dt> <dd>An access specifier is a keyword in a programming language that identifies whether an item, such as a field or a method, is or is not accessible from outside of an object.</dd> <dt>List the two access specifiers that are used in this course</dt> <dd>The two main access specifiers of this course are public and private.</dd> <dt>Describe the difference between &quot;private&quot; and &quot;public&quot; members of a class</dt> <dd>Private methods and fields are not accessible from outside the class (they are only internally accessible). Public methods and fields are accessible both from outside and from inside the class.</dd> <dt>Describe the concepts of &quot;Properties&quot; as used in OOP</dt> <dd>&quot;Properties&quot; allow for controlled access to read (get) or change (set) fields in a class. When fields are used with properties, the field is sometimes called a &quot;backing store&quot; because it stores the actual value that is accessed through the property.</dd> <dd>Properties do not have to have fields as &quot;backing stores&quot;; a property can calculate its value (during a get) instead of simply retrieving it from a field. These types of properties are sometimes called &quot;derived&quot; properties.</dd> <dd>A &quot;getter&quot; is a method whose sole responsibility is to provide a means for retrieving (getting) a value. Getters are typically (that is, almost always) public, thereby allowing information (typically stored in a field) to be &quot;extracted&quot; from outside the class.</dd> <dd>A &quot;setter&quot; is a method whose sole responsibility is to control the storing of a value into a field of a class.

Rather, the class constructor is &quot;called&quot; when an object is instantiated using the new keyword.</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;class scope&quot; as used in OOP</dt> <dd>Class scope is the idea that all of the methods and fields of a class are accessible to all the methods in a class.</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;local scope&quot; as used in OOP</dt> <dd>Local scope is the idea that all of the variables declared in a parameter list and inside of the body of a method are only accessible from within that method. In other words, parameters and &quot;local variables&quot; are only accessible from within the method (or block of code) in which they were declared.</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;state&quot; as applied to objects used in OOP</dt> <dd>&quot;State&quot; is the idea that objects have an &quot;internal value&quot; at any given point in time (as viewed from outside the class' methods). In other words, an object has &quot;state&quot; simply because it has fields which hold (or &quot;store&quot;) information.</dd> <dd>Objects are responsible for ensuring that their internal state is always valid (or &quot;stable&quot;) at the end of each method's execution.</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;override&quot; as used in OOP</dt> <dd>Override is a term used to indicate that a class is re-defining the behaviour of a method that it is inheriting from a base class.</dd> <dd>All classes inherit from a class called Object.

In other words, run-time errors are due to logical errors in a computer program. Sometimes these errors are &quot;fatal&quot; (meaning that they result in &quot;abnormal program termination&quot; - the program &quot;crashes&quot;).

In memory, this means that there is only one direct location in memory where the data is stored. The only data types that are &quot;value types&quot; are those that are built into the language: char, int, byte, short, long, double, float, and bool.<br>
For example, in the following statements,<br> <code>double count;</code><br> <code>count = 0;</code><br>
the value of zero is stored directly at the memory location labelled count.</dd> <dd>A &quot;reference type&quot; is a data type whose information is stored and accessible only &quot;indirectly&quot; through the variable. Whenever you declare a &quot;reference type&quot; variable, that variable actually stores a memory address of where the &quot;actual&quot; object is stored. The &quot;actual&quot; object is only created using the new keyword; that new keyword will set aside a separate, &quot;new&quot;, area of memory which is then accessed &quot;indirectly&quot; through the &quot;reference type&quot; variable.<br>
For example, in the following statements,<br> <code>Car hotrod;</code><br> <code>hotrod = new Car();</code><br>
the first line creates a single memory location, labelled hotrod, which will store the address to a Car object. The second line creates the actual Car object somewhere in memory and then the address to that object is stored in the hotrod variable.<br>
All classes, whether those supplied in the C# library (such as the String and Date classes) or those created by you, are &quot;reference types&quot;.</dd> <dt>Define the term Identifier</dt> <dd>An identifier is the term used to refer to some &quot;named&quot; item in your code.

Fields are variables with &quot;Class Scope&quot;, meaning that they are accessible to all the methods from within the class; properties, methods and constructors also have class scope. Parameters and variables declared within a method have &quot;local scope&quot;, meaning that they can only be accessed by code from within the method that they are declared in.</dd> <dd>Lifetime refers to the period of time from when a variable is first declared to the time that they are &quot;destroyed&quot;. For fields, their lifetime exists as long as the object in which they are declared. For parameters and local variables, they exist only as long as there is still code to be executed in the method to which they belong; as soon as the method &quot;returns&quot; or exits, these local variables and parameters are destroyed.</dd> <dt>Describe what is meant by the term &quot;expression&quot;</dt> <dd>An expression is any combination of literal values (literal strings or numbers), variables, operators, or method calls which return a value. An expression can be as simple as a single variable or literal value, or it can be as complex as a long mathematical expression that involves calls to various methods.</dd> <dd>An important characteristic of expressions is to note that they are always reduced to a single value by the computer.</dd> <dt>Explain the difference between program statements and expressions as well as how the two relate to each other</dt> <dd>A program statement represents a complete instruction that the compiler can translate into machine language. An analogy can be made that a program statement is like a sentence: Just as a sentence communicates a complete thought or idea, so a program statement represents a complete instruction.</dd> <dd>An expression is not a complete instruction; rather it is a combination of values, variables, method calls, and operators that will eventually be reduced to a single &quot;value&quot; by the computer. Expressions are often a part of program statements, and their role in program statements is akin to the role of phrases in English sentences: A phrase is not, by itself, a complete thought or idea; it must exist in a context in order to have its complete meaning. In a similar way, expressions play a part in the grammar of various kinds of program statements, providing a way of generating values that will be used by the program statement.</dd> <dt>List the four general sets of operators in C#</dt> <dd>Assignment, Arithmetic, Relational, and Logical</dd> <dt>Describe the two basic rules of using arithmetic operators that every compiler must follow.</dt> <dd>For an arithmetic operator to work, both sides of the operator must be the same data type.</dd> <dd>The resulting value of an arithmetic operation is of the same data type as the operands involved in the operation.</dd> <dt>Use the arithmetic operators to create arithmetic expressions</dt> <dd>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</dd> <dt>Explain what is meant by &quot;integer division&quot; and how that can be useful in solving particular problems regarding numbers.</dt> <dd>&quot;Integer division&quot; is the term for what occurs when both operands of a division operation are whole numbers (which can apply to byte, int, short, and long data types). Because the basic rule of arithmetic operations is that the data type of the final value of an operation is the same as that of the operands, any time we divide one whole number by another whole number, the result is a whole number: Any &quot;fractional portion&quot; is automatically discarded.<br>
For example,<br> <code>1 / 3 -&gt; 0</code><br> <code>7 / 2 -&gt; 3</code></dd> <dt>Explain the purpose of the modulus (%) operator.</dt> <dd>The modulus operator (%) is used to find the remainder of a division operation. This operator is typically used with integers.</dd> <dt>List and describe how to use the various assignment operators in C#</dt> <dd>All assignment operators require a variable on the left side and an expression on the right side. Assignment operators take the final value of the expression on the right and stores that value in the variable on the left.</dd> <dd>=<br>
This is the standard assignment operator. It performs a simple assignment of the value on the right to the variable on the left.</dd> <dd>+=<br>
This assignment operator takes the value on the right and adds it to the value already existing in the variable on the left. For example<br> <code>x += y;</code><br>
is the same as writing<br> <code>x = x + y;</code></dd> <dd>-=<br>
This assignment operator takes the value on the right and subtracts it from the value already existing in the variable on the left. For example<br> <code>x -= y;</code><br>
is the same as writing<br> <code>x = x - y;</code></dd> <dd>*=<br>
This assignment operator takes the value on the right and multiplies it to the value already existing in the variable on the left. For example<br> <code>x *= y;</code><br>
is the same as writing<br> <code>x = x * y;</code></dd> <dd>/=<br>
This assignment operator takes the value on the right and divides it into the value already existing in the variable on the left. For example<br> <code>x /= y;</code><br>
is the same as writing<br> <code>x = x / y;</code></dd> <dd>%/<br>
This assignment operator takes the value on the right and divides it into the value already existing in the variable on the left to generate the remainder. For example<br> <code>x %= y;</code><br>
is the same as writing<br> <code>x = x % y;</code></dd> <dt>Explain the difference between binary and unary operators</dt> <dd>Binary operators require a variable or value on both sides of the operator.</dd> <dd>Unary operators only require a variable or value on one side of the operator for it to perform its operation.</dd> <dt>Demonstrate understanding of operator precedence and how to override the default precedence of the arithmetic operators</dt> <dd>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</dd> <dt>Summarize and distinguish the rules for automatic type conversion involving arithmetic operators and the assignment operator</dt> <dd>Automatic type conversion takes place for the data types that are built in to the programming language.</dd> <dd>The basic rule of automatic type conversion involving arithmetic operators is that if two operands of a binary operator are of different data types, then the value of the one that is &quot;smaller&quot; is &quot;upsized&quot; to the data type of the &quot;larger&quot; operand.</dd> <dd>For the assignment operators, automatic type conversion is limited to only allowing the right-hand value to be converted to the data type of the variable on the left-hand side. Type conversion cannot convert a value from the right hand side if that value's data type is larger than the data type of the left hand side; if the right hand side is a larger data type than the left hand side, then a compiler error is generated that states the value cannot &quot;fit&quot; into the variable on the left.</dd> <dt>Determine the final data type for expressions involving mixed data types and type conversion</dt> <dd>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</dd> <dt>Describe &quot;type casting&quot; and explain how to use it appropriately.</dt> <dd>Type casting is where we explicitly tell the compiler to &quot;re-interpret&quot; a particular value as a different data type than what the compiler is currently treating it as.</dd> <dd>Type casting is appropriate when we want to avoid integer division in order to retain the fractional portion in the final result. For example, if the variables numerator and denominator are both integers, it is appropriate to use type casting in the following line of code:<br> <code>double value = (double) (numerator) / denominator;</code></dd> <dd>It is also appropriate when we need to &quot;downcast&quot; a value from a larger data type to a smaller data type (and can do so safely).</dd> <dd>Note that type casting does not (and can not) change the data type of a variable; type casting is only a re-interpretation of a value.</dd> <dd>Note that type casting is not the same as converting. For example, any attempt to type cast the char value of the character ‘4' to an int will not produce a numeric value of 4; rather, it will produce the numeric value of 52 (which is the underlying decimal value for the character ‘4').</dd> <dt>Compare and contrast the prefix and postfix behaviour of the unary arithmetic operators</dt> <dd>…</dd> <dt>Identify and explain how to use the common Math library routines (for Power, Square Root, Absolute, random numbers, pi, trigonometry, and the various types of rounding)</dt> <dd>…</dd> <dt>Use Math rounding methods with arithmetic expressions to round real numbers to a specific precision</dt> <dd>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</dd> <dt>Create random whole number values within a specific range</dt> <dd>…</dd> <dt>Use type casting appropriately in C#</dt> <dd>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</dd> <dt>Create constants in C#</dt> <dd>Constants in C# are created using the keyword final and assigning the value to the constant at the time that it is declared.

The main method is responsible to &quot;run&quot; (or &quot;execute) the program, and when the main method exits, the program closes and stops &quot;running&quot;. The length of time that a program is running is called its &quot;lifetime&quot;. As a program runs, it executes instructions in the program's code, one at a time; this is called the &quot;flow of execution&quot;.</dd> <dd>During the lifetime of a program, the main method creates objects and calls methods on those objects. Each method is basically a set of instructions to be executed. Those methods can, in turn, create other objects and call other methods.</dd> <dd>Whenever a method is called, the operating system keeps track of which method is calling another method through something known as a &quot;call stack&quot;.</dd> <dt>Describe what is meant by a &quot;call stack&quot;.</dt> <dd>A call stack is a mechanism to track which method is calling another method while the program is running. Call stacks allow the computer to know where to &quot;return to&quot; when a method exits.</dd> <dd>At any given point during the program's execution, the method that is currently executing is referred to as the &quot;called method&quot;. When the called method exits, it returns control back to the &quot;calling method&quot;, thereby allowing the calling method to continue its own execution.</dd> <dd>Whenever a method calls another method, the &quot;calling method&quot; pauses and waits for the &quot;called method&quot; to finish; once the called method returns, the calling method will resume executing its own code.</dd> <dt>Define the term &quot;Exception&quot;</dt> <dd>An exception is a message of some run-time error that has occurred in a program. Exceptions interrupt the normal flow of execution in methods, forcing the method to immediately exit. Methods generate exceptions by using the &quot;throw&quot; statement. Any method may generate an exception (including constructors).</dd> <dd>The throw statement exits the method by sending back an object (called an &quot;Exception Object&quot;, or simply an &quot;Exception&quot;) that can be used to identify the kind of error that has occurred. The calling method then has the opportunity to deal with (or &quot;handle&quot;) the error; if the calling method does not handle the error, then the exception continues to go back through the call stack until it finds a method that will handle the exception.</dd> <dd>If none of the methods on the call stack handle the exception that was thrown, control is eventually returned to the main method. If the main method does not handle the exception, then the exception is sent to the operating system. At that point, the operating system shuts down the program in what is called an &quot;abnormal program termination&quot;.</dd> <dt>Describe what is meant by the phrase &quot;raising (or throwing) an exception&quot;</dt> <dd>To &quot;raise an exception&quot; (or &quot;throw an exception&quot;) is to force a method to exit prematurely by sending back an &quot;Exception object&quot;.</dd> <dt>Describe the role that exceptions play in a computer program</dt> <dd>An exception is an interruption in the normal flow of execution in a method; exceptions force the method to immediately exit.</dd> <dd>Exceptions provide a way for methods (including constructors) to report errors to whatever code that is calling the method. These errors are usually (but not always) due to invalid information passed into the methods via the parameters. Through the use of exceptions, methods can perform validation on their parameters and report any errors that might prevent the method from being able to perform its task.</dd> <dt>Identify the three most commonly used Exception types used in this course.</dt> <dd>.NET Framework<br> <strong>ArgumentException</strong> - Typically thrown whenever an argument passed to a parameter does not have an &quot;acceptable&quot; value.<br>
For example, if a method has a parameter called &quot;percent&quot;, it might perform validation to ensure that the value is not less than zero or greater than 100. If the value is not valid, it may be appropriate to throw an ArgumentException.<br> <strong>ArgumentNullException</strong> - Typically thrown whenever an object is checked for and found to be &quot;null&quot;.<br>
(ArgumentNullException will be discussed in the topic on Enumerations and Composition.)<br> <em>Exception</em>* - This represents a general exception, and can be used whenever there is no other suitable exception type.</dd></dl> <h3 id="oop-basics-5"><a href="#oop-basics-5" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> OOP Basics</h3> <dl><dt>Explain why methods (including constructors) should perform validation of their parameter values</dt> <dd>One of the principles of object-oriented design is that objects must be responsible for ensuring that their fields have correct values. This is known as ensuring a &quot;valid state&quot; for an object.</dd> <dd>Typically, the values that are stored in fields come in through the parameters of a constructor or a method. Because objects are responsible for ensuring a valid state, the class' methods must check all parameters that might allow &quot;invalid&quot; data to be passed in.</dd> <dt>Explain the significance of raising an exception in the constructor</dt> <dd>If an exception is thrown from a constructor (or passes through it on its way up the call stack), the object's construction is interrupted. Because the construction of that object is interrupted, the object does not get instantiated.</dd> <dt>Use exceptions as part of the validation of parameter values in methods and constructors.</dt> <dd>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</dd> <dt>Explain why property setters are a good place for throwing exceptions.</dt> <dd>Generally speaking, the only method that should directly modify a field is the property setter associated with the field. Because of this principle, the property setter is the ideal place to perform validation and to throw exceptions. When validation takes place here, it eliminates the need for duplicating the validation elsewhere in the class.</dd> <dd>Validating input and throwing exceptions from within setters is a good way to follow the <em><strong>DRY</strong></em> principle: &quot;<strong>D</strong>on't <strong>R</strong>epeat <strong>Y</strong>ourself&quot;.</dd> <dt>Identify when constructors should throw exceptions directly.</dt> <dd>Whenever a field has a property setter that performs validation, the constructor should use that setter to store information in the field. If no property setter is available to process the parameter values sent through the constructor, then the constructor should perform its own validation on those parameters.</dd></dl> <h2 id="topic-h-case-structures"><a href="#topic-h-case-structures" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Topic H - Case Structures</h2> <h4 id="general-programming-concepts-and-terms-8"><a href="#general-programming-concepts-and-terms-8" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> General Programming Concepts and Terms</h4> <dl><dt>Describe the syntax of the switch statement</dt> <dd>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</dd> <dt>Discuss the limitations of the switch statement in C# and the available alternatives for the times that we can't use a switch statement</dt> <dd>Switch statements only work with integral data types (such as char and int).</dd> <dd>The individual case values must be constants; variable expressions are not allowed for the matching cases.</dd> <dd>Switch statements only check for exact matches (meaning that there is an implied &quot;is-equal-to&quot; comparison); other relational comparisons, such as greater than or less than, are not allowed.</dd> <dd>When it is not possible to use switch statements, case structures can be written up as nested and/or stacked if-else structures to make use of the if-else statement.</dd></dl> <h2 id="topic-i-enumerations-and-composition"><a href="#topic-i-enumerations-and-composition" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Topic I Enumerations and Composition</h2> <h3 id="general-programming-concepts-and-terms-9"><a href="#general-programming-concepts-and-terms-9" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> General Programming Concepts and Terms</h3> <dl><dt>Define the term Enumeration</dt> <dd>An enumeration is a simple program-defined data type with a limited set of possible values. Enumerations represent information that is &quot;conceptual&quot; in nature (as opposed to information that is textual, numeric, or complex).<br>
For example, a coin has two sides that are commonly referred to as HEADS and TAILS. Rather than creating two constant strings with the values &quot;Heads&quot; and &quot;Tails&quot; and a String variable called FaceShowing, you can use an enumeration.</dd> <dd>There are two parts to enumerations:<br>
a. The name of the enumeration, which is the name of the new data type; this is sometimes referred to as the &quot;enumerated data type&quot;.<br>
b. A set of enumerated values, which represent all of the possible values for a variable of that enumerated type. These values act like &quot;constants&quot; that can be used to distinguish different &quot;states&quot; for the conceptual data.</dd> <dt>List the benefits of using enumerations</dt> <dd><strong>Type Safety</strong> - Enumerations allow a program to be &quot;type safe&quot;, meaning that there is less likelihood of creating logical errors or other mistakes through the use of constants or literal values.</dd> <dd><strong>Code Readability</strong> - Enumerations make code more readable than constants or literal values (like integers).</dd> <dd><strong>Compatibility with Switch Statements</strong> - Enumerations are compatible with switch statements, making them a great option for describing distinct values for matching against different cases. Because enumerations are like constants, and are treated as integral data types by the compiler, they are often the best choice when working with case structures.</dd> <dd><strong>Useful as Flags</strong> - Because the programmer can associate specific integer values to the enumerated values, it is possible to use an enumerated data type to create complex &quot;flags&quot; for representing distinct &quot;states&quot; that can be combined together.<br>
For example, if you had an enumerated type such as the following, you could combine two states together in a variable's value to represent distinct but compatible states, such as <code>ACTIVE</code> and <code>MEDIUM_PRIORITY</code>.</dd></dl> <div class="language-csharp extra-class"><pre class="language-csharp"><code><span class="token keyword">enum</span> Status

Enumerations only define a set of possible values, and each variable defined by an enumeration can only hold one of those possible values at any given time; there is no inner complexity to enumerations, as there is with classes.</p></dd> <dt>Use enumerations to define simple data types that are conceptual in nature and that have a limited set of possible &quot;values&quot;</dt> <dd><p>Demonstrate your ability to meet this learning outcome guide by completing the related assignments.</p></dd></dl> <h3 id="oop-basics-6"><a href="#oop-basics-6" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> OOP Basics</h3> <dl><dt>Describe the idea of Composition</dt> <dd><p>Composition refers to the situation where one or more of the fields in a class are objects.
