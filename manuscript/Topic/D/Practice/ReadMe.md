# Practice Exercises

1. [Person](Person.md) - This simple class was used to introduce the idea of encapsulation (private fields with public properties). This example uses a constructor for ensuring the state of an object when it is instantiated (created). It also demonstrates the overriding of the ToString() method inherited from the Object method. 
2. [CanadianAddress](CanadianAddress.md) - This class represents an address for some place in Canada.
Update this class to now include a constructor and to override the ToString() method.
3. [Course](Course.md) - This class represents a post-secondary course with a theory (exam) and a lab portion.
4. [ExamResult](LabResult.md) - This class represents the results of an exam for a student.
5. [LabResult](ExamResult.md) - This class represents the results of a lab for a student.

For this exercise, take the code solutions you created in the previous topic and compare your results with the jUnit tests for these classes; check with your instructor to see where you can download the unit tests.
