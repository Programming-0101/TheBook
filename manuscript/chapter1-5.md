# The C# Language

C# (pronounced 'See-sharp') is a programming language developed by Microsoft and rooted in the earlier languages of C and C++. C# is an Object-Oriented programming language that has evolved quite a bit over time, with each released version adding new features and capabilities to the language. At present, C# is in version 6.0 and version 7.0 is under development.

***TODO:***

- instructions are always placed inside **methods** (in fact, a method can be defined as a "set of instructions").
- Methods always appear inside of **classes** or similar structures.
- Keywords for primitive data types
- Categories of data types:
  * Value types
  * Reference types
- C# is an "extensible" language - allowing one to define new complex data types with their own information and instructions for processing that information.
