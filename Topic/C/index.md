# Topic C – Starting Classes

## Overview

This topic introduces some of the basic syntax and grammar surrounding Object-Oriented Programming in C#. The following keywords are introduced. (Note that additional keywords from previous topics may also be present.)

• private 
• this 
• bool
• true 
• false
• DateTime

This topic will also introduce the following grammars, syntax and language constructs. (Note that additional concepts from previous topics may also be present.) 

• Private fields (encapsulation) 
• Public properties (encapsulation) 
• Constructor syntax 
• Object instantiation with parameterized constructors 
• Overriding the Object's ToString() method

### Daily LOGs

The following daily LOGs are covered in this package. 

#### OOP Basics

• Define the term "encapsulation" as used in OOP 
• Explain why encapsulation is a good design principle 
• Define the term “access specifier” and identify where it occurs in the code for a class
• List the two access specifiers that are used in this course
• Describe the difference between “private” and “public” members of a class
• Describe the concepts of "properties" as used in OOP 
• Define the term "backing store" as it applies to properties and fields
• Describe and explain the purpose and function of a constructor for a class
• Describe the syntax of a class constructor
• Identify when a class constructor is “called”
• Define the term "class scope" as used in OOP 
• Define the term "local scope" as used in OOP 
• Define the term "state" as applied to objects used in OOP 
• Define the term “override” as used in OOP
• Explain the purpose and function of the ToString() method and why we sometimes want to change its default behaviour when we create classes  
• Create simple class diagrams to represent classes 

#### General Programming Concepts and Terms 

• List three levels of scope
