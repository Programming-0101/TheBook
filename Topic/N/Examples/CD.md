# CD

This class represents a CD of Songs. It supports a public method to get long songs (which are songs whose RunningTime is greater than the average running time). A private method called resizeArray() is created to “modularize” this public method’s behaviour.

* getLongSongs() - Refactor this method so that the code that resizes the array of songs is put into its own private method, called resizeArray.
