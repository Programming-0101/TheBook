# Topic N - Modularization and Utility Classes

## Overview

This topic examines the technique of modularization as a way to simplify complex logic. In addition, this topic looks at the use of "utility" classes to aid in simplifying code and enabling better "code-reuse" for repetitive tasks. This technique of "simplifying" complex logic is also known as "refactoring".

Modularization will be examined in the context of simplifying the internal working of a class’ methods and in the context of organizing and simplifying a driver. For classes, modularization is simply taking any repetitive or overly-complex code out of the class’ existing methods and placing that code inside of private methods. For console drivers (which typically consist of static methods), ***to be continued...***
