# Topic K - Looping and Collections

## Overview

This topic provides further examples of looping logic, but involves the use of collections. All of these samples make use of the List<T> class to maintain a collection or group of objects.

The List<T> class is a Generic class, meaning that the item in the angled brackets - <T> - is a placeholder for the name of the actual class that is being managed in the List. For example, to have a list of Integers we would declare that as List<Integer>. Likewise, if we wanted a list of Student objects, it would be declared as List<Student>.

The List<T> class supports a number of methods and properties for working with the collection.

* Add() – Used to add an item to the collection
* [index] – Used to retrieve an item in the collection
* Remove() – Used to remove an item from the collection
* Count – Identifies the number of items in the collection
