# Code Samples

The following examples are used to illustrate this topic.

1. StockItem - This class represents an item that is part of an inventory. The item has an item name, a cost and a profit margin (which can be positive or negative). By using the profit margin, it can derive the price of the item. The class can also report if the item is priced at or below cost. 
2. Account - This class illustrates simple if structure in handling withdrawals; withdrawals are only made when the amount does not exceed the balance and the overdraft. It also identifies if the account is overdrawn. 
3. Person - This adaptation of the person class checks the age of the person to see if the person's life stage is infant, toddler, preschooler, school age, or adult. 
4. Fraction - This class now ensures that any negative denominators have their negative sign "moved" to the numerator. It also recognizes whether a fraction is proper (numerator less than denominator) or not and provides a method to express the fraction as a mixed number string. 
5. Angle - This version of the Angle class includes an attribute to identify the type of the angle as either acute, right, obtuse, straight, reflex, full rotation, or undefined. 
6. ParkingCounter - This class represents a simple counter to monitor whether a parking lot is full or not; it tracks vehicles entering and leaving the parking lot and allows the counter to be reset when the lot is full or empty. This class illustrates increment and decrement operators and/or the assignment increment or assignment decrement operators.
7. MemoryAddress - This class represents a single memory address in both its base 10 and hexadecimal value.
8. Color - This class represents a color as three base-10 RGB values and as a single hexadecimal value.
9. Base16 - This class represents an integer value as a base-16 hexadecimal number.
