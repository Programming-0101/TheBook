# Practice Excercises

* [MemorySize](MemorySize.md) - The MemorySize class is a simple representation of a given amount of memory rounded to the nearest Kb, Mb, Gb, Tb.
* [Rectangle](Rectangle.md) – "All squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares." This class represents a simple rectangle with a height and width. From this information, the area, perimeter and diagonal can be obtained; it can also be determined if the rectangle is or is not square.
* [HazardousMaterial](HazardousMaterial.md) – The HazardousMaterial class is a simple representation of the six main classes of hazardous materials (A through F). This class maps a classification code with a general description of the material's classification:
  * Class A – Compressed Gas
  * Class B – Flammable and Combustible Material
  * Class C – Oxidizing Material
  * Class D – Poisonous and Infectious Material
  * Class E – Corrosive Material
  * Class F – Dangerously Reactive Material
* [CurrencyCalculator](CurrencyCalculator.md) – This exercise extends the previous CurrencyCalculator exercise by allowing the conversion from a foreign currency to US dollars.
* [GravityCalculator](GravityCalculator.md) – This exercise extends the previous GravityCalculator exercise by allowing the conversion to a weight on Earth from a weight on another planet in our solar system.
