# Topic F â€“ If-Else Structures

## Overview

This topic introduces the if-else control flow statement and demonstrates both simple and complex conditional expressions. This topic will also introduce how to nest program statements.

### LOGs

#### General Programming Concepts and Terms

* Describe and draw a diagram of the If-Then-Else logical structure
* Identify the programming statement that corresponds to the If-Then-Else logical structure
* Translate If-Then-Else structures into code
* Describe what is meant by a "conditional expression"
* List the operator precedence for mixing logical, arithmetic, and relational operations
* List the relational operators
* List the logical operators
* Use relational, logical, and arithmetic operators to construct conditional expressions
* Demonstrate an understanding of operator precedence in conditional expressions
* Use statement blocks to allow nesting program statements into control structures
* Define the term "boundary condition" as it relates to if-else statements and testing
* Identify the correct way to compare or check the contents of strings in conditional expressions
* List and describe the commonly used properties and methods of the String class that would be used in if-else statements
