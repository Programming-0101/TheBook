# Nothingness

This class represents the absolute minimum code required to code a class. Even though it's not a very "useful" class, it does provide and introduction to the ideas of classes, keywords and identifiers.

```csharp
namespace Topic.A.Examples
{
    public class Nothingness
    {

    }
}
```
