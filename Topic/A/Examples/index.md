# Code Samples

The following examples are used to illustrate this topic.

1. Nothingness - This class represents the absolute minimum code required to code a class. Even though it's not a very "useful" class, it does provide and introduction to the ideas of classes, keywords and identifiers. 
2. HelloWorld - This adaptation of the classic "Hello World" program illustrates static methods. This example includes and introduces the concept of a "driver". 
3. Comments - This class is not really "functional", but is intended to illustrate the basic types of comments allowed in the programming language.
