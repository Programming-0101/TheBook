# Code Samples

The following examples are used to illustrate this topic.

1. [Nothingness](Nothingness.md) - This class represents the absolute minimum code required to code a class. Even though it's not a very "useful" class, it does provide and introduction to the ideas of classes, keywords and identifiers.
1. [Program](Program.md) - This class is the one you typically see anytime you create a new project in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
1. [HelloWorld](HelloWorld.md) - This adaptation of the classic "Hello World" program illustrates static methods. This example includes and introduces the concept of a "driver".
1. [Comments](Comments.md) - This class is not really "functional", but is intended to illustrate the basic types of comments allowed in the programming language.
