# Your First Program

The first console program most people are introduced to is called "Hello World". That's because the first thing we often show is how to output text to the screen, and saying "Hello" is a friendly way to introduce yourself.

```csharp
using System;

namespace StartHere
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```
