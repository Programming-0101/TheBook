# CanadianAddress

This class represents an address for some place in Canada. 

**Problem Statement:**

Create the CanadianAddress class so that it can represent the majority of possible addresses that some place may have in Canada. Design the class to have only public fields, as specified in this document.

* Data Attributes of the CanadianAddress class:
  * Street : String
  * Unit : String
  * City : String
  * Province : String
  * PostalCode : String
  * RuralRoute : String
  * BoxNumber : String

Also create a driver for testing this class; you may use any name for the driver as long as it is not already mentioned in this package. In the driver, create instances of the CanadianAddress class that represent your current address as well as the address of your school (use hard-coded data).
