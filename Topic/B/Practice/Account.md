# Account

Extend the Account class from the example to include more information.

**Problem Statement:**

Extend the Account class from the example to include more information. Specifically, include an AccountType:String, BankName:String, BranchNumber:Integer, and InstitutionNumber:Integer.

Also modify the driver to make use of the added information.

*Notes*

The branch number and the institution number together make up the Transit Number for a bank. "The bank transit number is 8 digits long. This is divided into a 5 digit branch number and 3 digit institution code, for example 10000-200." (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wikiSort_code)
