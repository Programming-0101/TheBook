# AnsweringMachine

The AnsweringMachine class provides a method to give an answer to an incoming phone call.

**Problem Statement:**

Create the AnsweringMachine class so that it can provide a default answer for an incoming phone call as well as a customizable answer. The methods should be named answer and they should return a String. There should be two methods in total, and both of them should be declared as instance members (non-static). The actual content of the default message can be whatever you choose, while the customizable method will receive a single String argument that has the name of the person receiving the message. 

Also create a driver that demonstrates the AnsweringMachine in a Console environment

Create a driver for the AnsweringMachine class that creates an instance of the class and displays the results of calling the answer methods.
