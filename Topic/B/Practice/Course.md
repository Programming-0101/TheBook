# Course

This class represents a post-secondary course with a theory (exam) and a lab portion. 

**Problem Statement:**

Create the Course class so that it represents a post-secondary course. Design the class to have only public fields, as specified in this document.

* Data Attributes of the Course class:
  * CourseName : String
  * CourseNumber : String
  * ExamCount : Integer
  * LabCount : Integer
  * ClassHours : Integer

Also create a driver for testing this class; you may use any name for your driver as long as it is not already mentioned in this package. In the driver, instantiate all of the first term classes you are taking and populate those objects with data (use hard-coded data).
