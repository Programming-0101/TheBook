# ExamResult

This class represents the results of an exam for a student. 

**Problem Statement:**

Create the ExamResult class so that it represents the results of an exam written by a student. Design the class to have only public fields, as specified in this document.

* Data Attributes of the ExamResult class:
  * Name : String
  * TotalMarks : Integer
  * MarksEarned : Real
  * ExamWeight : Integer
  * StudentId : Integer

Also create a driver for testing this class; you may use any name for the driver as long as it is not already mentioned in this package. In the driver, instantiate all of the exams you have taken to date in this course and populate those objects with data (use hard-coded data).
