1. Aggregator – countItems(), minValue()
2. Math – factorial(), isPrime(), power(), and greatestCommonDenominator()
3. GuessingGame – This example expands on the sample GuessingGame by 1) re-working the guess() method to make guessing more efficient by using the SecretNumber’s guessWithHint() method, and 2) overloading the guess() method to continue guessing until the correct answer is found (and returning the number of attempts it took to find the correct answer).
