* SortBoxes() - This private method performs a bubble sort of the array of SafetyDepositBox objects. The boxes are to be sorted in ascending order according to their box number.
* Find() - This public method performs a binary search of the SafetyDepositBox array for a particular box number. If the box number is not found, it returns a null.
