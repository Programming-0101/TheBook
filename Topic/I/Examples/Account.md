# Account + AccountType

The Accountâ€™s account type is n  * longer being represented as a string, but is its own enumeration: AccountType.

**Problem Statement**

Write the code that will make the account type a type-safe value for the Account class. The solution must meet the following requirements (new requirements are in **bold**):

* Should get the bank name, branch number, institution number, account number, balance, overdraft limit, and account type and allow the overdraft limit to be set
* Should support deposits
* Should only support withdrawals if the amount does not exceed the sum of the balance and the overdraft limit, otherwise an exception stating "Insufficient Funds" should occur
* Should identify if the account is overdrawn
* Should require bank name and account type (that is, they cannot be empty or null)
* Should trim the bank name
* **Should ensure that the Account Type is type-safe and that it is supplied when creating the account (that is, it cannot be null)** 
* **Should support the following types of accounts: Chequing, Saving, Credit Card, and Line of Credit**
* Should verify that the branch number is six digits and the institution number is three digits
* Should require an opening balance
* Should not allow a negative overdraft limit

Use the following class diagram when creating your solution.
