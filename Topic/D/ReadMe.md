# Topic D â€“ Testing and Debugging

## Overview

This topic introduces the concepts of testing and verifying that code is running correctly. Two approaches will be presented and compared: Ad-hoc test drivers and Unit Tests.

Test drivers that rely on user input/output are the traditional means of verifying that code runs properly. The biggest benefit of test drivers is that they provide quick "ad-hoc" tests and are simple to produce on any IDE. However, test drivers have some major downfalls.

Current programming techniques make use of Unit Tests. A unit test is a simple, isolated test of some part of a class. Unit tests provide a way to clearly show the success or failure of a particular section of code. Unit tests are a key part of Test Driven Development (TDD).

Regardless of whether the developer uses test drivers or unit tests, it is important to remember that the developer is still responsible to make sure that the tests (and thus, the test results) are valid. Improper use of test drivers and unit tests can lead to
* "false positives" - indicating that something works when it really doesn't, and 
* "false negatives" - indicating that something is broken when it really isn't 

Note: For this course, students will be provided with unit tests and will not be expected to have to write their own unit tests. The unit tests supplied to students will use nUnit 2.5.7 which is already installed in the lab. To use these libraries at home, simply install nUnit 2.5.7 on your home computer.

Debugging is all about finding and fixing problems (bugs/errors) in your code. There are two kinds of errors you can have in your code: **Compile-time** errors and **run-time** errors.

## Compile-Time Errors

Compile-time errors are when the compiler doesn't understand your code. These happen when the code you write doesn't follow the syntax/grammar rules of your programming language. These are also called **syntax errors**. Until these are fixed, your program won't run at all. Knowing how to fix these is only possible by learning and apllying the grammar rules of your programming language.

The thing about syntax errors is that the compiler will tell you when and where it started getting confused by the code you wrote.

## Run-Time Errors

Run-time errors are trickier to find and fix. That's because run-time errors are basically problems with the *logic* of your code. Your code will compile, and the program will "run", but it won't do what you expect or intended! It's like a logical fallacy in an English sentence: "Draw a square circle." The grammar is correct, but the idea is flawed (there is no such thing as a square circle).

Run-time errors are also often unseen (apart from extensive testing), and it's not unusual (but certainly un-wanted) to have them reported by the end-users of your code before they are found by the programmers.
