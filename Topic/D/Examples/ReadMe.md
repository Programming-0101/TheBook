# Code Samples

The following examples are used to illustrate this topic.

1. Person - This simple class was used to introduce the idea of encapsulation (private fields with public getters and setters). This example uses a constructor for ensuring the state of an object when it is instantiated (created). In this topic, it is used to demonstrate unit testing. 
2. Account - This simple class also illustrates encapsulation, but with some of the fields being read-only. This class uses a constructor (which is also necessary for getting state into fields which do not have corresponding setter methods). 
3. Student - This class reinforces the idea of encapsulation and constructors. It also demonstrates the idea of overloading the default ToString() method that every class inherits from the Object class. 
4. Employee â€“ The Employee class represents basic information about an employee of a company.
5. Company - These are other classes similar to the Person and Student classes. These classes, however, "share" a driver, illustrating the fact that any given "program" typically uses more than one class.

Unit Tests (nUnit)
The unit tests for these classes are included in the solution folder under the "Demos + Practice" folder. Simply double-click the NUnit Test Project (.nunit) and the tests will open in the NUnit GUI.
