# DeckOfCards

The DeckOfCards class represents a complete deck of cards. When the deck is first created, a card is created for each suit. The DeckOfCards supports two public methods: Draw() and Shuffle(). Modify the DeckOfCards class to support shuffling of the deck.

* Shuffle() – This method resets the deck to a full deck of cards and then “shuffles” the deck until the cards are randomly distributed through the collection.
