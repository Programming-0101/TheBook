# Code Samples

1. Math - The Math class is modified to produce the sequence of Fibonacci numbers as an array.
2. PhoneBook - The PhoneBook class provides simple management of an array of PhoneNumber objects. The PhoneBook allows for adding and retrieving phone numbers; it supports search for phone numbers by the telephone number or by a last name. The PhoneBook is initialized with a physical limit for the arrays, and the actual number of entries in the phone book is tracked as phone numbers are added to the phone book.
3. ClassList - The ClassList example maintains an array of students for a particular course by offering methods to add and remove students from a course. In addition, the ClassList ensures that students are not added to the course twice (based on the student's Id). The internal array is of a fixed size (ClassList.CLASS_LIMIT) as well as the logical size of the array. If the ClassList is provided with an array of students in its constructor, that list is “copied” to the internal array of the ClassList object.
4. MultipleChoiceMarker - This class is used for marking multiple choice exams. It takes an array of MultipleChoice objects as the answer key when it is first created. It provides a method to mark the student's answers.
5. BankStatement - This class represents a bank statement for a BankAccount for a given month. The statement allows BankTransaction objects to be added, and performs deposits and withdrawals on the BankAccount. The statement reports the starting and ending balance and also summarizes the total amount deposited and withdrawn for the month. 
6. DeckOfCards -The DeckOfCards class represents a complete deck of cards. When the deck is first created, a card is created for each suit. The DeckOfCards supports a method to draw a card.
