# Code Samples

* PhoneNumberFileAdapter - This reads a text file to fill a list of PhoneNumber data.
* StudentFileAdapter - This reads a text file to fill a list of Student data.
* BookFileAdapter - This reads a text file to fill a list of Book data. Note that in this example, not every field in the record structure is used in creating the required Book objects; unused fields are simply read and “discarded” by the BookFileAdapter. In addition, the Book class and text file used in this example allows for a book to have multiple authors.
* SafetyDepositBoxFileAdapter - This reads a text file to fill a list of SafetyDepositBox data. Note that in this particular example, some records may not have an account number for the box number.
