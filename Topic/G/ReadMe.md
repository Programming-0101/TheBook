# Topic G â€“ Raising Exceptions

## Overview

This topic introduces the throw statement and exceptions. The following new keywords are introduced.
* throw
* throws

This topic will demonstrate objects that are capable of validating information supplied to them. This introduces the principle in object oriented design that well designed objects are capable of ensuring the validity of their internal state. When invalid information is supplied, either through the constructor or through other methods, objects can respond by raising exceptions.
