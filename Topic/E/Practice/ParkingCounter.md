# ParkingCounter

This class represents a simple counter to monitor whether a parking lot is full or not; it tracks vehicles entering and leaving the parking lot and allows the counter to be reset when the lot is full or empty. This class illustrates increment and decrement operators and/or the assignment increment or assignment decrement operators.

**Problem Statement**

Write the code that will monitor vehicles entering and leaving a parking lot. Modify the class to add a method `ResetLotWithCars(int numberOfCars)`. The solution must meet the following requirements:

* Should track vehicles entering
* Should track vehicles leaving
* Should get total parking spots
* Should get open (empty) spots
* Should reset lot as full (that is, fill the parking lot)
* Should reset lot as empty (that is, clear all the parking spots of vehicles)
* Should reset lot occupancy with a set number of cars

Use the following class diagram when creating your solution.
