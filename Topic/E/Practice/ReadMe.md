# Practice Exercises

* [Calculator](Calculator.md) – This exercise expands on the original Calculator class to perform subtraction and division with integers.
* [Fraction](Fraction.md) – This exercise expands on the original Fraction class to include methods that allow for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions.
* [Square](Square.md) – This exercise expands on the original Square class to include a method that determines the diagonal of a square.
* [Coordinate](Coordinate.md) – ***Not Yet Implemented*** The Coordinate class represents a geographical co-ordinate for either longitude or latitude. A Coordinate's value can be expressed either as a real number or as degrees, minutes and seconds. It makes use of integer division and overloaded constructors.
* [PaintEstimator](PaintEstimator.md) – The PaintEstimator class is used to estimate the number of paint cans needed for painting a simple room (with or without a window). It makes use of a constant and the Math library; it also uses overloaded constructors.
* [BulkItem](BulkItem.md) – The BulkItem class represents products that are available in bulk and shows the cost of individual items. It makes use of rounding (to two decimal places).
* [Die](Die.md) - This exercise expands on the original Die class to allow for creating a die of any number of sides, with a default of six sides. This means that there is an overloaded constructor. 
* [RoundingCalculator](RoundingCalculator.md) – This exercise demonstrates rounding using separate methods for each level of rounding precision.
* [GenericRoundingCalculator](GenericRoundingCalculator.md) – This exercise demonstrates rounding to the nearest whole number of fractional number using a couple of "generic" methods.
* [PeopleCounter](PeopleCounter.md) – This simple class is used to count the number of people who have entered a store in a single day. It takes a simplistic approach, counting each person entering and leaving, estimating the number of people for the day by dividing the total count by two.
* [ScoreCard](ScoreCard.md) – ***Not Yet Implemented*** This class represents a scorecard for tracking bowling scores frame by frame. It produces a final tally for the game, as well as the current score and the current frame. 
* [Cylinder](Cylinder.md) – The Cylinder class represents a cylindrical object whose height and radius is known. The class provides methods to calculate the volume and surface area.
* [Cone](Cone.md) – The Cone class represents a conical object whose height and base radius is known. The class provides methods to determine the volume and surface area with this information.
* [GravityCalculator](GravityCalculator.md) – The GravityCalculator provides static methods for determining an object's weight for the various planets in our solar system, given the equivalent weight as found on Earth.
* [CurrencyCalculator](CurrencyCalculator.md) – The CurrencyCalculator allows the conversion of US dollars to four other currencies, given the current exchange rate of those currencies.
* [ParkingCounter](ParkingCounter.md) - This class represents a simple counter to monitor whether a parking lot is full or not; it tracks vehicles entering and leaving the parking lot. Modify the class to add a method `ResetLotWithCars(int numberOfCars)`.

For these exercises, compare your results with the unit tests for these classes.
