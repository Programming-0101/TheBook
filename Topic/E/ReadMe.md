# Topic E – Expressions and Math

## Overview

This topic introduces concepts surrounding the use of arithmetic expressions and common Math library routines.

This topic will introduce the following grammars, syntax and language constructs. (Note that additional concepts from previous topics may also be present.)

* Arithmetic expressions
* Assignment statements
* Automatic type conversion and casting
* Integer division
* String concatenation
* Math library routines and constants (such as Random, Square Root, and π)

This topic will also take a deeper look at the distinctive aspects of variables, values and data types as well as demonstrate the use of overloaded constructors. This is also the first foray into creating classes that actually "do something" – these classes not only maintain state but also provide methods to generate other information besides that which is stored in a class' fields.

### LOGs

#### OOP Basics

* Explain how method overloading is applied to constructors

* Explain what is meant by the phrase "type extensibility"
* Define the terms Reference Type and Value Type as they apply to data types in C#
* Define the term Identifier
* Create and initialize variables in C#
* Explain what is meant by the terms "scope" and "lifetime" as they apply to variables

* Summarize and distinguish the rules for automatic type conversion involving arithmetic operators and the assignment operator
* Determine the final data type for expressions involving mixed data types and type conversion
* Describe "type casting" and explain how to use it appropriately.
* Compare and contrast the prefix and postfix behaviour of the unary arithmetic operators
* Identify and explain how to use the common Math library routines (for Power, Square Root, Absolute, random numbers, pi, trigonometry, and the various types of rounding)
* Use Math rounding methods with arithmetic expressions to round real numbers to a specific precision
* Create random whole number values within a specific range
* Use type casting appropriately in C#
* Create constants in C#
