# OuterSpace

This class is the simplest possible class (and, coincidentally, one of the most useless). 

**Problem Statement:**

Create a class called OuterSpace. This class has no members at all (it is empty, like outer space). Add a multi-line comment at the beginning that should include your full name as the author of the class. Also make an XML comment for the class as a whole.
