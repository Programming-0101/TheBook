# PhoneBook

Extend the PhoneBook class by adding sorting by name and a binary search when sorted by number.

* FindPhoneNumberUsingBinarySearch() - This private method will do a binary search of the PhoneNumber array to find a PhoneNumber with a matching telephone number.
* BubbleSortByLastNameThenFirstName() - This private method sorts the array by first name within last name, in ascending alphabetical order.
